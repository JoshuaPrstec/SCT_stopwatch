## Definitions

**Software:** Refers to SCT Stopwatch and BT Stopwatch, including any updates, patches, bug fixes, enhancements, or modifications.  
**Licensee:** The individual or entity granted the rights to use the Software under this agreement.  
**Licensor:** The owner and creator of the Software, Joshua Prstec, who grants the licence to the licensee.

## Grant of Licence

Subject to the terms of this Software Licence Agreement, Joshua Prstec hereby grants to the licensee a royalty-free, revocable, limited, non-exclusive licence to use, modify, distribute, and copy the Software. The licensee is not permitted to make a charge for distributing the Software or any modifications thereof, either for profit or merely to recover media and distribution costs.

## Intellectual Property

All rights, titles, and interests in the Software and its associated intellectual property, including but not limited to images, graphics, animations, code, and trademarks, are owned by the Licensor and/or South Canberra Tuggeranong Athletics Club. No part of the intellectual property in the Software, including but not limited to logos, trademarks, and code, may be used by the Licensee except as permitted under this Agreement.

## Software Specifics

**SCT Stopwatch:** Contains brand names and logos that are not owned by the Licensor but are used under rights granted by South Canberra Tuggeranong Athletics Club. The licensee must respect these rights.  
**BT Stopwatch:** Functions identically to SCT Stopwatch but does not contain any third-party brand names or logos.

## Obligations and Limitations

The Licensor has no obligation to provide support beyond what is outlined in the installation and usage guide. The Licensor may update the Software as needed but is not obligated to update or maintain the Software.

## Reproduction and Modification

Any reproductions, modifications, or duplicates of the Software must include this licence agreement and attribute Joshua Prstec as the original author.

## Liability and Warranty

The Licensee agrees that Joshua Prstec shall not be liable to the Licensee, or any other related person or entity claiming any loss of profits, income, savings, or any other consequential, incidental, special, punitive, direct or indirect damage, whether arising in contract, tort, warranty, or otherwise. Even if Joshua Prstec has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations shall necessarily apply regardless of the primary purpose of any limited remedy. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to the Licensee. The limitations herein apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.

​​Joshua Prstec, author of the Software, expressly disclaims any warranty for the Software. The Licensed Product and all applicable documentation is provided as-is, without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Accordingly, the Licensee accepts any risk arising out of the use or performance of the Software.

## Termination

In the event of termination, all licences provided under this agreement shall immediately terminate, and you agree to discontinue accessing or attempting to access this Licensed product and to destroy any copies of the software. Accordingly, this licence may be:

1. Automatically terminated if the Licensee fails to comply with any of the terms and conditions under this agreement;  
2. Terminated by Joshua Prstec; or  
3. Terminated by the Licensee.

Termination of this Agreement does not affect any rights or obligations that have accrued prior to termination.  
Either Joshua Prstec or the Licensee may terminate this licence agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party, including but not limited to electronic mail. Joshua Prstec is contactable at [Joshuaprstec@gmail.com](mailto:Joshuaprstec@gmail.com).

## Governing Law

This licence shall be deemed to be construed under the jurisdiction of the courts located in the Australian Capital Territory, without regard to conflicts of laws as regards the provisions thereof. Any legal action relating to this licence shall be brought exclusively in the courts of Australia, and all parties consent to the jurisdiction thereof. Furthermore, the prevailing party in any action to enforce this licence shall be entitled to recover costs and expenses including, without limitation, legal fees. Accordingly, this licence is made within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Australian Capital Territory, and its jurisdiction shall supersede any other jurisdiction of either party's election.

## Entire Agreement

This Agreement rightly constitutes the entire understanding between Joshua Prstec and the Licensee and all parties involved. It supersedes all prior agreements of the parties, whether written or oral, express or implied, statement, condition, or a representation or warranty. If any part of this agreement is found unenforceable, the remainder will continue to apply. By using, modifying, distributing, or copying the Software, you agree to the terms of this licence.
